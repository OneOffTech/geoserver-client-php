# GeoServer PHP Client

The client enables programmatic access to a [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) instance.

As of now it offers the following features:

* [x] Obtain the [version](#get-the-geoserver-version) of the connected GeoServer instance
* [x] [Create workspace](#create-the-workspace) or retrieve existing workspace details
* [x] [Create datastores](#data-stores) and listing them
* [x] [Create coveragestores](#coverage-stores) and listing them
* [x] [Upload files](#uploading-geographic-files) in various [formats](#supported-file-formats)
* [x] [Manage styles](#styles) in SLD format

If you find issues or want to contribute a feature, [open an issue first](https://github.com/OneOffTech/geoserver-client-php/issues/new)

**Requirements**

- [PHP 7.1](http://www.php.net/) or above.
- [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) 2.13.0 or above

## Getting Started

### Installation

The GeoServer client uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. 

```bash
composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter guzzlehttp/psr7 oneofftech/geoserver-client-php
```

The GeoServer client is not hard coupled to [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) or any other library that sends HTTP messages. It uses an abstraction called [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/). This will give you the flexibilty to choose what PSR-7 implementation and HTTP client to use.

**Why requiring so many packages?**

GeoServer client has a dependency on the virtual package
[php-http/client-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/client-implementation) which requires to you install **an** adapter, but we do not care which one. That is an implementation detail in your application. We also need **a** PSR-7 implementation and **a** message factory. 

You do not have to use the `php-http/guzzle6-adapter` if you do not want to. You may use the `php-http/curl-client`. Read more about the virtual packages, why this is a good idea and about the flexibility it brings at the [HTTPlug docs](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/users.html).

### Usage

#### Creating a client

To create a GeoServer client use the `GeoServer::build` method. 
It will give you back a configured client instance.

As of now the client can handle 1 workspace at time by design.

```php
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoServer;
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\Auth\Authentication;

/**
 * Define a workspace to use
 */
$workspace = 'your-workspace';

$authentication = new Authentication('geoserver_user', 'geoserver_password');

$geoserver = GeoServer::build($url, $workspace, $authentication);
```

#### Get the GeoServer version

Once you have a client instance, you can verify the GeoServer version number using `version()`

```php
// assuming to have a GeoServer instance in the $geoserver variable
$version = $geoserver->version();
// => 2.13.0
```

#### Create the workspace

The client can create the configured workspace if not available. 
To do so call `createWorkspace()`:

```php
$workspace = $geoserver->createWorkspace();
// => \OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Workspace
```

In case the creation goes well or the workspace already exists, a `Workspace` instance is returned.

#### Retrieve the workspace details

The `workspace()` method retrieve the details of the configured workspace

```php
$workspace = $geoserver->workspace();
// => \OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Workspace
```


#### Data stores

A datastore is a container of vector data. A workspace can have multiple data stores.

You can retrieve all defined datastores using the `datastores()` method:

```php
$datastores = $geoserver->datastores();
// => array of \OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\DataStore
```

Or retrieve a datastores by name:

```php
$datastore = $geoserver->datastore($name);
// => \OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\DataStore
```

You cal also delete a data store via:

```php
$result = $geoserver->deleteDatastore($name);
// => true || false
```

#### Coverage stores

A coveragestore is a container of raster data. A workspace can have multiple coverage stores.

You can retrieve all defined coverage stores using the `coveragestores()` method:

```php
$coveragestores = $geoserver->coveragestores();
// => array of \OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\CoverageStore
```

Or retrieve a coveragestores by name:

```php
$coveragestore = $geoserver->coveragestore($name);
// => \OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\CoverageStore
```

You cal also delete a coverage store via:

```php
$result = $geoserver->deleteCoveragestore($name);
// => true || false
```

#### Upload and Delete geographic files

##### Uploading geographic files

Uploading a file to a geoserver instance is done via the `upload` method.

The client recognizes the format and create a correct store type, e.g. shapefiles lead to a 
datastore creation. To do so the file path must be wrapped in a `GeoFile` object.

> See [Supported files](#supported-file-formats) for knowing what the library can handle

```php
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoFile;

$file = GeoFile::load('path/to/shapefile.shp');
// => OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoFile{
//     + mimeType
//     + extension
//     + format
//     + type
//     + name
//     + originalName
//    }
// it will throw OneOffTech\GeoServer\Exception\UnsupportedFileException in case the file cannot be recognized
```

From a GeoFile instance the file `mimeType`, `format` and `type` (`vector` or `raster`, `OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoType`) can be discovered.

The `format` is used to specify the content of the file, as in some cases Geographic files do not have a standard mime type. 
For example a Shapefile mime type is `application/octet-stream`, which means a binary file.

The `originalName` attribute contains the original filename and a `name` property. By default `originalName` and `name` are equals, 
but the name can be changed, by using the `name($value)` method. The `name` will be used as the store name inside GeoServer.

Once obtained a `GeoFile` instance, the method `upload()` can be used to really upload the file to the GeoServer:

```php
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoFile;

$file = GeoFile::load('path/to/shapefile.shp');

$feature = $geoserver->upload($file);
// OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Resource
```

> For file character encoding please refer to [File Character Encoding](#file-character-encoding)

Once uploaded, the return value will be an instance of the `OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Resource`.
It contains the details extracted by the GeoServer, like the bounding box.

`OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Resource` has two sub-classes:

- `OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Feature` A feature type is a vector based spatial resource or data set that originates from a data store 
- `OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Coverage` A coverage is a raster data set which originates from a coverage store.

##### Verify if a geographic files exists

As a helper method, given a `GeoFile` instance, is possible to verify that a corresponding Feature or Coverage is present.

```php
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoFile;

$file = GeoFile::load('path/to/shapefile.shp');

$exists = $geoserver->exist($file);
// true || false
```

> The identification currently uses the name assigned to the GeoFile

##### Delete a geographic file

As a helper method, given a `GeoFile` instance, is possible to delete the corresponding Feature or Coverage in the Geoserver.

```php
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoFile;

$file = GeoFile::load('path/to/shapefile.shp');

$removed = $geoserver->remove($file);
// true || false
```

> The identification currently uses the name assigned to the GeoFile

#### Styles

The client can upload, retrieve and delete styles defined within the configured workspace

##### Upload style file

To upload a style, a `StyleFile` instance representing the file on disk is required.
Once the instance is obtained use the `uploadStyle` method on a GeoServer client instance.

The style will be uploaded as part of the workspace styles.

```php
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\StyleFile;

$file = StyleFile::from('/path/to/style.sld');
// => OneOffTech\GeoServer\StyleFile{
//     + name
//     + originalName
//     + mimeType
//     + extension
//    }
// it will throw OneOffTech\GeoServer\Exception\UnsupportedFileException in case the file cannot be recognized

// You can change the style name before uploading it to avoid collision. By default the filename will be used.
$file->name('my_custom_style');

$style = $geoserver->uploadStyle($file);
// => OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Style
```

##### Retrieve a style

The client let you retrieve a style by its name

```php
$style = $geoserver->style('style_name');
// => OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Style
```

> The name must be equal to the one given for the upload.
> It might not be the file name

##### Retrieve all styles

You can also retrieve all styles defined in the workspace

```php
$styles = $geoserver->styles();
// => array of OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Style
```

##### Remove a style

Style removal is performed by giving the style name to the `removeStyle` method. 
The method will return the details of the deleted style.

```php
$style = $geoserver->removeStyle('style_name');
// => OneOffTech\GeoServer\Models\Style
```

> the `$style->exists` attribute will be set to `false` after deletion

## Supported file formats

The library is able to recognize:

- `Shapefile`
- `Shapefile` inside `zip` archive
- `GeoTIFF`
- `GeoPackage` format version 1.2 (can contain both vector and raster data, but will be reported as vector)
- Styled Layer Descriptor `SLD` files for layer styles in XML format

You can check if a file is supported using

```php
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\GeoFile;
use OneOffTech\GeoServer\StyleFile;

$isSupported = GeoFile::isSupported($path);
// => true/false


// For style files, the support is available with the StyleFile class
$isSupported = StyleFile::isSupported($path);
// => true/false
```

> The library supports only the file formats that can be uploaded to a GeoServer. 
> For example `Geojson`, `KML` and `GPX` are not supported out-of-the-box by GeoServer,
> although plugins might be available for doing that

## File Character Encoding

GeoServer can deal with character encoding of layers/features, but tests highlighted
a limited support when using UTF-8 for data/coverage store names.

To prevent issues with UTF-8 features attributes, the client set the character encoding
to UTF-8 when uploading a file. In this way GeoServer will consider UTF-8 as the
character encoding for features/attributes contained in the file. This do not affect
layer or store names.

As by design decision the store name is the filename, or the assigned name when 
performing the upload, we highly reccomend to use ASCII characters for it.
Use of UTF-8 encoded filenames (or store name) might prevent the client to retrieve the 
store/layer corresponding to the uploaded file.

## Testing

The library is covered with unit and integration tests. 

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

By default integration tests are not executed unless in the phpunit.xml file a GeoServer instance is specified.

The `phpunit.xml.dist` define the `GEOSERVER_URL`, `GEOSERVER_USER`, `GEOSERVER_PASSWORD` for that purpose. 
If you want you can copy `phpunit.xml.dist` to `phpunit.xml` and edit those variables in place 
or define them in your environment variables.

```xml
<env name="GEOSERVER_URL" value="http://localhost:8600/geoserver/"/>
<env name="GEOSERVER_USER" value="user"/>
<env name="GEOSERVER_PASSWORD" value="pass"/>
```

If you don't have a GeoServer instance to trash there is a `docker-compose.yml` file that, with 
the help of Docker and the [kartoza/geoserver image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kartoza/geoserver/), 
creates a running GeoServer instance on port 8600.

> Be aware that the Kartoza GeoServer image requires [4GB of RAM](https://github.com/kartoza/docker-geoserver/blob/master/Dockerfile#L23-L25) to run

```bash
docker-compose -f ./tests/docker-compose.yml up -d
# here better to wait for the full startup of the geoserver
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
